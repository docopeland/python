# Retrieving GEOData
# Download the code from http://www.py4e.com/code3/geodata.zip - then unzip the file and edit where.data to add an
# address nearby where you live - don't reveal where you live. Then run the geoload.py to lookup all of the entries in
# where.data (including the new one) and produce the geodata.sqlite. Then run geodump.py to read the database and p
# roduce where.js. You can run the programs and then scroll back to take your screen shots when the program finishes.
# Then open where.html to visualize the map. Take screen shots as described below. Make sure that your added location
# shows in all three of your screen shots.
